## Principles of Microservice Deployment

* Isolated execution: each microservice instance has its own computing resources and cannot impact other instance.
* Focus on automation: as the number of microservices increases, automation becomes increasingly important.
* Infrastructure as code: represent the configuration for your infrastructure.
* Zero-downtime deployment: deploying a new version of a microservice can be done without any downtime.
* Desired state management: use a platform that maintains your microservice in a defined state.
