## Switch Branch

If you switch branch with uncommitted changes, it must be compatible with the new branch.

So you should stash or commit you changes before you switch branch.

## Stash Changes

```bash
git stash list
git stash push [-m "msg"]
git stash <apply/pop> [n] # number in the list, 0 (default).
```
